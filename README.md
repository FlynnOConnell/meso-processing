# LBM and Mesoscopic Data Processing in Python

A *very* rough and dirty draft of a python translation of the Light Beads Microscopy with MAxiMuM Module: Data processing pipeline and work flow from the [Vaziri Lab](https://vaziri.rockefeller.edu/).

Original MATLAB code/software written by Jeffrey Demas: https://github.com/vazirilab/MAxiMuM_processing_tools 

**Motivation**

Python offers several advantages in the world of scientific computing and data processing.
Notably, powerful libraries such as CaImAn, Suite2p, and NormCorre have ceased maintaining their MATLAB versions, pivoting fully to Python implementations.

#### With this translation, our goal is twofold:

- Develop a Library: Craft a robust Python library to process both LBM and general mesoscopic datasets.
- Deep Dive into LBM: Use this as an opportunity to delve deeper and gain a comprehensive understanding of the LBM data processing pipeline.

I will be updating the JupyterNotebook walkthroughs as I start to understand the workflow.
